        <p>My name is Luis Renteria II. I was born in 1984 in Houston. My formative years 
            happened to conincide with the information age and the advent of the 
            internet. Experiencing this I recognized at an early age that technolgy would be my 
            ticket to a better life.

            I took some networking classes in high school, and afer the Navy 
            I studied Information Systems Management in college. In the Navy I was an 
            Information Systems Technician and this helped me land my first job out 
            of the servie, which lead to my  transferring into SharePoint Administration 
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint">SharePoint</a> is a 
            Microsoft application). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout college and since graduating in 2014 I have held a series of 
            progressive SharePoint roles that can be coorelated to my consistently 
            deepening knowledge of the SharePoint platform and all underpinning 
            technologies. This journey has culminated now to my 
            joining the Digital Crafts bootcamp.
